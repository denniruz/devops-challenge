Add words via a PUT to /words with a json body.

curl -i -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X PUT -d '{"word":"cheese"}' http://localhost:5000/words

This accepts only one word at a time, and will error on multiple or blank words.

A GET to /words/WORDNAME will return a count of the the number of times that word has been entered:

curl http://localhost:5000/words/cheese

{ "cheese" : 2 }

A GET to /words will return a json array of the count of all entered words
